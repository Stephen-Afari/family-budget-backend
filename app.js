//express.json(): This is a built-in middleware function in Express that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser. It extracts the JSON data from the request body and makes it available under req.body.
//When a request is sent to the server, if the requestâ€™s Content-Type is application/json, express.json() middleware will automatically parse the JSON-formatted request body.
//The parsed JSON object is then assigned to req.body so that it can be accessed in your route handlers.

//Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle.
//The next() function is critical in Express middleware. It tells Express to move on to the next middleware function in the stack. If next() is not called, the request will hang, and the response will not be sent to the client.
