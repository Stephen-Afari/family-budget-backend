//The multer package is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is used for uploading files in Node.js applications
//multipart/form-data is a content type used for uploading files and submitting forms that contain binary data. It's commonly used when you need to send files, such as images or documents, as part of a form submission.
//Multi-Part Requests: multipart/form-data allows a form to be submitted as multiple parts, each with its own content type and encoding. Each part can contain different types of data, including files.
//Form Encoding: When a form is submitted with multipart/form-data, the browser encodes the form fields and files into the request body, separating each part with boundary markers.
//Server Parsing: On the server side, a library or middleware (like multer for Node.js) parses the incoming request body, extracts the form fields and files, and makes them available for processing.
